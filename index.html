                What is the Difference Between the FSW Bootcamp & the FCS

                FCS covers the foundational concepts of programming. It’s a
                starting point for those new to programming or a refresher for
                those who studied computer science before. Knowledge of the
                concepts provided in FCS is required for FSW. It can also be
                taken ‘informally’ for free if you do not plan to continue to
                FSW Bootcamp or you are unable to commit to the online courses
                via Udemy: Free Computer Science Tutorial - Foundations of
                Computer Science: Theory and Practice. The FSW Bootcamp offers
                holistic training in web development (coding, designing,
                testing, and bug fixing). It tackles advanced technical concepts
                and offers soft skills training that prepares you for the job
                market. FCS requires only a part-time commitment, and FSW
                requires a full-time commitment. Please note that both are
                intensive and require your commitment and dedication.
